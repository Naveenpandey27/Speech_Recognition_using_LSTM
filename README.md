# Speech_Recognition_using_LSTM
Speech recognition using LSTM is a project that involves using deep learning techniques to train a neural network to recognize and transcribe spoken words. Specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited for sequence processing tasks such as speech recognition.
